### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="820" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" width="820"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="820" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, user preferences, and timeslot data in JSON format and read them back into model objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefsStorage`, and `TimeslotsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the Model component (because the Storage component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the Model)
* delegates JSON conversion to classes such as `JsonSerializableAddressBook` / `JsonAdaptedPerson` for the address book and `JsonSerializableTimeslots` / `JsonAdaptedTimeslot` for timeslots.
* provides concrete implementations like `JsonAddressBookStorage`, `JsonUserPrefsStorage`, and `JsonTimeslotsStorage` which read/write files on disk.

The `StorageManager` class,
* composes the individual storage providers (address book, prefs, timeslots)
* exposes unified operations so `MainApp`, `Logic`, and other components access persistence through a single entry point

The timeslots file location is configurable via `UserPrefs` and the application will create or populate the file with sample timeslots when none is present.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Noteworthy details on features**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## Feature: Storing, Adding And Managing Timeslots

### Implementation overview
The Timeslots feature is implemented as a set of commands that parse user input into command objects, interact with the Model to read or mutate the stored timeslots, and return a CommandResult. Commands are implemented following the existing Command/Parser pattern used across the codebase (AddressBookParser -> XCommandParser -> XCommand). Some commands are read-only (e.g. get-timeslots) while others modify state (e.g. block-timeslot, unblock-timeslot, add-consultation, clear-timeslots).

### Data model
- Timeslot: stores start and end LocalDateTime; used for generic blocked timeslots.
- ConsultationTimeslot: extends Timeslot and includes an associated student name; serialized to JSON with an explicit studentName field.
- Timeslots are stored in a Timeslots collection inside ModelManager and are persisted by Storage (JsonTimeslotsStorage).

<puml src="diagrams/TimeslotsClassDiagram.puml" width="574" />

### Command flow
Typical lifecycle for a timeslot command:
1. User input â†’ AddressBookParser creates the specific CommandParser.
2. Parser validates prefixes/arguments and constructs a Command instance (e.g., BlockTimeslotCommand).
3. LogicManager executes the Command (command.execute(model)).
4. Command manipulates the Model (reads or mutates Timeslots) and returns a CommandResult.
5. LogicManager persists changes (see [Persistence & UI](#persistence--ui)) and returns the CommandResult to the caller/UI.

Sequence diagrams:
- Block timeslot: <puml src="diagrams/BlockTimeslotSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />
- Unblock timeslot: <puml src="diagrams/UnblockTimeslotSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />
- Clear timeslots: <puml src="diagrams/ClearTimeslotsSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />
- Get timeslots: <puml src="diagrams/GetTimeslotsSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

### Persistence & UI
- Persistence: LogicManager is responsible for writing persistent files. After a successful command execution, LogicManager saves the address book and, if available, timeslots via StorageManager.saveAddressBook(...) and StorageManager.saveTimeslots(...).
- UI scheduling: Some commands (e.g., get-timeslots) produce a timeslot ranges payload inside CommandResult. When present, LogicManager schedules the UI update using Platform.runLater(() -> TimeslotsWindow.showTimetable(...)). This call:
  - Is performed asynchronously on the JavaFX thread to avoid blocking command execution.
  - Is guarded in LogicManager with a try/catch to ignore IllegalStateException in headless environments (unit tests).
  - Is only invoked when CommandResult contains non-empty timeslot ranges.

### Validation and error handling
- Argument parsing: CommandParsers validate required prefixes (ts/ and te/) and perform flexible datetime parsing (ISO and human-friendly formats). Parsers throw ParseException with user-facing messages on invalid format.
- Command execution: Commands validate business rules (e.g., no overlapping timeslots, consultations with duplicate student/time). On violation a CommandException is thrown with a clear message.
- Persistence errors: LogicManager translates IO or permission errors (IOException, AccessDeniedException) from Storage into CommandException so callers can surface the error to users.

### Feature: Undo Command

#### Implementation
The undo mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It stores a single previous state of the address book and
timeslots, stored internally as `previousAddressBookState` and `previousTimeslotsState`. Additionally, it implements
the following operations:

* `Model#saveAddressBook()` â€” Saves the current address book and timeslots state before modification.
* `Model#undoAddressBook()` â€” Restores the previous address book and timeslots state.
* `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` â€” Checks if there is a previous state available to undo to.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and
`Model#canUndoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `ModelManager` will be initialized with the
initial address book and timeslots state, with `previousAddressBookState` and `previousTimeslotsState` set to `null`
(no previous state to undo to).

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoState0.puml" with="574" />

**Step 2.** The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#saveAddressBook()` before deleting, saving the current state. After the deletion, the current state is
modified but the previous state preserves the state before deletion.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoState1.puml" with="574" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveAddressBook()`, so the previous state will
not be updated.

</box>

**Step 3.** The user executes `add n/John Doe â€¦â€‹` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls
`Model#saveAddressBook()` before adding, which **replaces** the previous state with the current state (ab1),
then adds the new student.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoState2.puml" with="574" />

**Step 4.** The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by
executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which restores the address book
to the previous state (ab1) and sets both `previousAddressBookState` and `previousTimeslotsState` to `null`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoState3.puml" with="574" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If `previousAddressBookState` is `null`, then there is no previous state to restore. The `undo` command
uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than
attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Important:** This implementation only supports undoing **one command** at a time. After undoing once, you must
execute another modifying command before you can undo again. There is no redo functionality.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" with="574" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" with="574" />

**Step 5.** The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book,
such as `list`, `find`, or `get-timeslots`, will not call `Model#saveAddressBook()`. Thus, the previous state remains `null`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoState4.puml" with="574" />

**Step 6.** The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#saveAddressBook()` before clearing. The current state (ab1)
is saved as the previous state, then all persons are deleted, creating a new current state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoState5.puml" with="574" />

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/SaveActivityDiagram.puml" with="574" />

#### Commands that support undo
The following commands call `Model#saveAddressBook()` and thus support undo:
- `add` - Adds a student
- `delete` - Deletes a student
- `edit` - Edits a student
- `clear` - Clears all students
- `marke` - Marks an exercise
- `marka` - Marks attendance
- `grade` - Marks grade of an assessment
- `block-timeslot` - Adds a timeslot
- `unblock-timeslot` - Unblock a timeslot
- `clear-timeslots` - Clears all timeslots
- `add-consultation` - Adds a consultation
- `set-week` - Sets current week

The following commands do NOT support undo (read-only commands):
- `list` - Lists all students
- `find` - Finds students
- `filter` - Filters students
- `sort` - Sorts students base on some criteria
- `get-timeslots` - Displays timeslots
- `get-consultations` - Gets consultation schedule
- `help` - Shows help
- `exit` - Exits the application

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves only one previous state (address book + timeslots).
    * Pros:
        * Simple to implement and understand.
        * Minimal memory usage (only doubles the data size at most).
        * No complex state management or pointer tracking.
    * Cons:
        * Cannot undo multiple commands in sequence.
        * Cannot undo a command once a new data-modifying command is executed.
        * No redo functionality.

* **Alternative 2:** Save entire history in a list with pointer.
    * Pros:
        * Can undo multiple commands in sequence.
        * Supports redo functionality.
    * Cons:
        * More complex to implement and maintain.
        * Higher memory usage (stores multiple states in a list).
        * Need to carefully manage state pointer and list boundaries.

* **Alternative 3:** Individual command knows how to undo itself (Command Pattern with undo).
    * Pros:
        * Memory efficient (only store minimal data needed to reverse each command).
        * Can undo multiple commands.
        * Each command encapsulates its own undo logic.
    * Cons:
        * Much more complex - every command must implement its own undo logic.
        * Must ensure correctness of each command's undo implementation.
        * Harder to maintain and test.
        * Increased development time for new commands.

**Rationale for Alternative 1:** For the scope of this project, a simple single-level undo is sufficient for most use
cases. Users typically need to undo only their most recent action, and the simplicity of implementation outweighs the
benefits of a full undo/redo stack. The minimal memory overhead and straightforward logic make this approach ideal for
a student project with limited development time.

#### Future enhancements
* **Multiple undo levels:** Implement a full history stack (Alternative 2) to support undoing multiple commands in
  sequence. This would involve storing a list of states and maintaining a current state pointer.

* **Redo functionality:** Allow users to redo commands that were undone. This would require preserving the "future"
  states after an undo operation until a new modifying command is executed.

* **Selective undo:** Allow undoing specific commands in history rather than just the most recent one. This would
  require implementing Alternative 3 with command-specific undo logic.

* **Undo command confirmation:** For destructive commands like `clear`, prompt the user to confirm before executing,
  reducing the need for undo in the first place.

### Feature: Multi-Index Input Support

#### Overview
LambdaLab supports commands that can target **multiple students at once** through the use of **multi-index inputs**.  
This feature is powered by the `MultiIndex` and `MultiIndexCommand` classes, which together allow users to specify **a single index** (e.g., `2`) or **a contiguous range** (e.g., `1:5`) when executing commands.

This enables bulk operations such as grading, marking attendance, or updating exercises â€” all in one concise command.

#### Implementation
**MultiIndex**

The `MultiIndex` class represents a list of one or more indices that can be written using the following syntax:
- A **single index** (e.g., `1` â†’ only the first student)
- A **range of indices** (e.g., `1:5` â†’ students 1 through 5, inclusive)

It exposes methods such as:
- `isSingle()` â€” checks if the command applies to one student only.
- `toIndexList()` â€” returns a list of all `Index` objects represented by the multi-index input.

**MultiIndexCommand**

Commands that use this feature extend the abstract class `MultiIndexCommand`,  
which defines a template for commands that support updates for multiple students at once using the [MultiIndex syntax](#multiindex-syntax).

Each subclass:
1. Implements `applyActionToPerson(Model model, Person person)` â€” defining how each student is modified.
2. Optionally overrides `buildResult(List<Person> updatedPersons)` to customize the final success message.

**Subclasses that extend `MultiIndexCommand`:**

| Command Class           | Command Word | Description                              |
|--------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `MarkAttendanceCommand`  | `marka`       | Marks lab attendances.                   |
| `MarkExerciseCommand`    | `marke`       | Marks exercises for completion.          |
| `GradeCommand`           | `grade`       | Marks exams as passed or failed.         |
| `DeleteCommand`          | `delete`      | Deletes students from LambdaLab.         |
| `EditCommand`            | `edit`        | Edits students in LambdaLab.             |

#### Example Usage
**Example 1: Single Index**
```
marka 5 l/3 s/n
```
Marks Lab 3 as *absent* for the student at index `5` of the student list.

**Example 2: Range of Indices**
```
grade 1:3 en/midterm s/y
```
Marks the *Midterm* exam as *passed* for students 1 through 3.

A sequence diagram for this command is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/GradeCommand/GradeSequenceDiagram.puml" width="820" />

### Feature: Displaying Trackable Data

#### Overview
LambdaLab displays each studentâ€™s academic progress using **trackable components**, which visually represent data such as **exercise completion**, **lab attendance**, and **exam performance**.  
This feature leverages the `Trackable` interface and its implementing classes to unify how progress information is retrieved and displayed within the UI.

Each trackable component defines both:
- The **status colours** (e.g., green, red, grey) that indicate the current state.
- The **labels** (e.g., EX1, L5, MIDTERM) used to identify individual tracked items.

#### Implementation
The **Trackable Display** feature enables LambdaLab to visually represent a studentâ€™s **exercises**, **lab attendance**, and **exam results** in a consistent and colour-coded format.

This is achieved through the `Trackable` interface, which standardizes how trackable data is exposed to the UI.  
Each of the following classes implements `Trackable`:

- `ExerciseTracker` â€“ tracks completion status of exercises.
- `LabList` â€“ tracks attendance for lab sessions.
- `GradeMap` â€“ tracks examination results.

When a `PersonCard` is created, it directly retrieves these three trackers from the `Person` object:
1. `person.getExerciseTracker()`
2. `person.getLabAttendanceList()`
3. `person.getGradeMap()`

For each tracker, the `PersonCard`:
- Calls `getLabels()` to obtain display names (e.g., **EX1**, **L3**, **MIDTERM**).
- Calls `getTrackerColours()` to obtain their corresponding colour codes (`GREEN`, `GREY`, or `RED`).
- Dynamically generates a label for each item and applies the appropriate CSS class based on its colour.

This design cleanly separates **model data** from **UI rendering**, ensuring that any future updates to how data is displayed require no changes to the model logic.

<puml src="diagrams/Trackable/TrackableClassDiagram.puml" width="800" />

### **Example**
Each student card displays their current progress in three areas:

| Category | Green Meaning | Grey Meaning | Red Meaning |
|:----------|:---------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| **Lab** | Attended | Not conducted yet | Absent |
| **Exercise** | Completed | Not completed | Overdue |
| **Exam** | Passed | Not graded | Failed |

This provides a concise and visual summary of each studentâ€™s standing in the course.

### Feature: Find Command

#### Current Implementation
The `find` mechanism performs a multi-keyword search over student records with **presence-only selectors** to restrict which fields are searched.
Keywords are taken from the preamble (e.g., `find alice bob`), while empty selectors (e.g., `n/`, `g/`) 
act as flags to limit the searched fields. If no selectors are provided, all supported fields are searched.

Each selector creates a separate `Predicate` with the `keywords` then they are combined into a combined `PersonContainsKeywordPredicate`
and passed to a `FindCommand`. The command then updates the modelâ€™s filtered list in one step.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the key interactions for `execute("find <KEYWORD> [selectors]")`.

<puml src="diagrams/findCommand/find.puml" width="820" />

#### Parsing & Validation
- `FindCommandParser` tokenises input into a preamble and selectors.
- It rejects inputs with **no keywords** or **non-empty selectors** (e.g., `n/Alice`) to enforce presence-only flags.
- Selected fields are determined from which selectors appear; otherwise all fields are chosen.
- Per-field predicates are OR-combined into a single `PersonContainsKeywordPredicate`
that matches when **any** keyword is a case-insensitive **substring** of **any** selected field.

#### Model Update
- `FindCommand#execute(Model)` calls `model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` once.
- The UI observes the filtered list and refreshes automatically.

### Feature: Set Week Command

The `set-week` command allows teaching assistants to set the current week of the semester (0-13). This is a crucial command as it determines which labs are considered "past" and affects the behavior of lab attendance marking
and exercise tracking throughout the application.

**How it works:**

1. The user executes `set-week <WEEK_NUMBER>` where `WEEK_NUMBER` is between 0 and 13
2. The `SetWeekCommandParser` parses the input string and creates a `Week` object
3. The `SetWeekCommand` is executed, which:
    - Saves the current state to enable undo functionality
    - Updates the current week in the `Model`
    - Updates the static current week in `LabList` and `ExerciseTracker` classes
    - Updates all existing students' lab and exercise tracking data to reflect the new week
4. The system displays a success message showing the new week number and how many students were updated

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `LambdaLab` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

**Use case: Mark student attendance**

**MSS**

1.  User wants to mark attendance, enters student name and lab number using the command format
2.  System validates the student index and lab number
3.  System marks the studentâ€™s attendance for the specified lab
4.  System confirms that attendance for <studentName> is marked for lab number <labNumber>
    Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 1a. User provides an invalid index/lab number
    * 1a1. System displays error message
    * 1a2. User re-enters a valid index/lab number


      Use case resumes at Step 2
* 3a. Attendance for the student in that lab number has already been marked
    * 3a1. System displays message to indicate that attendance is already marked for <studentName> in lab number <labNumber>

      Use case ends.


**Use case: Schedule a consultation**

**Precondition: User has blocked out timeslots corresponding to his/her schedule**

**Actor:User**

**MSS**
1. User views all the periods of available time he has
2. User adds a desired consultation time slot
3. Timeslot is saved into his/her schedule

**Extensions**
* 2a. User inputs an invalid consultation slot (e.g. start time before end time)
    * 2a1. System displays error message
    * 2a2. User re-enters a valid timeslot

      Use case resumes at Step 3
* 3a. User wants to modify the saved consultation
    * 3a1. User requests to edit or delete the consultation.
    * 3a2. System allows modification or cancellation

      Use case ends.

**Use case: Add a student**

**Precondition: The user has the student's details**

**MSS**
1. User wants to add student, enters required fields (student ID, name, phone, email, GitHub username) using the command format
2. System validates the required fields
3. System adds the new student
4. System displays a confirmation message with the added student's summary.

**Extensions**
* 2a. Required field missing or invalid
  * 2a1. System displays error message
  * 2a2. User adds in missing field or re-enters a valid field

  Use case resumes at Step 3
* 2b. Duplicate student ID
  * 2b1. System returns error message to show student already exists
  * 2b2. User re-enters a valid student ID

    Use case resumes at Step 3

**Use case: Filter students by exercise**

**Precondition: LambdaLab contains student records**

**MSS**
1. User wants to filter by exercise completion, enters exercise index and status using command format
2. System validates the exercise index and status
3. System displays the filtered list

Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 1a. User provides an invalid exercise index/status
    * 1a1. System displays error message
    * 1a2. User re-enters a valid exercise index/status

      Use case resumes at Step 2

**Use case: Sort students by lab attendance**

**Precondition: LambdaLab contains student records**
**MSS**
1. User wants to sort by lab attendance, enters lab attendance as sort criterion in command format
2. System displays the sorted list

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  The system should respond to any command within 1 second.
5.  Core functionalities should be covered by automated tests to ensure that future changes do not break the existing features
6.  Users should be able to run the application simply by executing a JAR file, without needing to run an installer.
7.  Should be able to function fully offline.
8.  Date persistence should not depend on an external database system. Storage should be file-based and embedded.
9.  User data should not be lost due to unexpected situations (e.g., unexpected shutdowns).
10. Should be able to support multiple screen resolutions (e.g., 1280Ã—720 and above) without layout issues.
